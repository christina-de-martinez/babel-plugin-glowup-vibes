# âœ¨ Glowup Vibes âœ¨

## The most goated Babel plugin

This plugin was high key inspired by an Instagram reel by @justin.makes.things: <https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cwn5KYtIWDm/>

I was shook. I thought it hit different so I said "bet" and started flexin on em. IYKYK fam.

Here's my stitch on Instagram: <https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cxvwz76vBus/>

## What does it do?

It transpiles internet slang into valid JavaScript.

This was a fun project to increase my AST rizz. I'm a Babel simp now ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ

## How to use it

- Install `npm install babel-plugin-glowup-vibes --save`
- Set up babel and add `babel-plugin-glowup-vibes` to your list of plugins
- Highkey start flexing. Use the options outlined in [Options](#options). Running your build command should be a major W. Look for big JavaScript vibes wherever you set the output to go (in our example below, it'll be in `lib/compiled.js`)

In case you need more detailed instructions than that:

To set up babel, create a `babel.config.json` file and add the following to it:

```json
{
  "presets": [
    [
      "@babel/preset-env",
      {
        "targets": {
          "edge": "17",
          "firefox": "60",
          "chrome": "67",
          "safari": "11.1"
        },
        "useBuiltIns": "usage",
        "corejs": "3.6.5"
      }
    ]
  ],
  "plugins": ["babel-plugin-glowup-vibes"]
}
```

Add something like this to your `package.json` file:

```json
"scripts": {
    "build": "babel ./src/script.js --out-file ./lib/compiled.js"
},
```

Note: this was designed using Babel 7 and I haven't tested it on anything else. I super don't guarantee that this is totally flawless.

## Contributing

I welcome PRs if you can think of ways to make this even more bussin.

Your PR will be merged faster if you do these things:

- Update the table in the README
- Provide an example in example.js
- Test your work by running `npm run build` and checking `compiled.js` to see whether it worked how you thought
- Format your code by running `npm run test`
- Bonus points if you write tests

If you want to contribute, but you don't know where to start, that's great! Watch this YouTube video to learn more about Babel plugins: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aK6n0pYcOe8>

AST explorer is also a great tool to learn about ASTs and test some of your ideas. <https://astexplorer.net/>

## Does this exist in (insert coding language)?

There is a C++ version! <https://twitter.com/lauriewired/status/1684329735399313409>

PyGyat is a similar preprocessor for Python <https://www.pygyat.org/>

@renancaraujo created a Dart version: <https://pub.dev/packages/glowup_vibes>

@chelseas created a Julia version: <https://github.com/chelseas/GlowupVibes.jl>

Other than that, the answer is probably no. But you should make one!!

Honorable mention: Thy Script, the 1500s version <https://github.com/dlustre/babel-plugin-thy-script>
