# âœ¨ Glowup Vibes âœ¨

## The most goated Babel plugin

This plugin was high key inspired by an Instagram reel by @justin.makes.things: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cwn5KYtIWDm/

I was shook. I thought it hit different so I said "bet" and started flexin on em. IYKYK fam.

Here's my stitch: https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cxvwz76vBus/

## What does it do?

It transpiles internet slang into valid JavaScript.

This was a fun project to increase my AST rizz. I'm a Babel simp now ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ

## How to use it

- Install `npm install babel-plugin-glowup-vibes --save`
- Set up babel and add `babel-plugin-glowup-vibes` to your list of plugins
- Highkey start flexing. Use the options outlined in [Options](#options). Running your build command should be a major W. Look for big JavaScript vibes wherever you set the output to go (in our example below, it'll be in `lib/compiled.js`)

In case you need more detailed instructions than that:

To set up babel, create a `babel.config.json` file and add the following to it:

```
{
    "presets": [
        [
            "@babel/preset-env",
            {
                "targets": {
                    "edge": "17",
                    "firefox": "60",
                    "chrome": "67",
                    "safari": "11.1"
                },
                "useBuiltIns": "usage",
                "corejs": "3.6.5"
            }
        ]
    ],
    "plugins": ["babel-plugin-glowup-vibes"]
}
```

Add something like this to your `package.json` file:

```
"scripts": {
    "build": "babel ./src/script.js --out-file ./lib/compiled.js"
},
```

| ghosted                  | return null                    |
| lowkey.stan("message")   | console.log("message")         |
| lowkey.sus("message")    | console.warn("message")        |
| lowkey.cringe("message") | console.error("message")       |
| throw new L("message")   | throw new Error("message")     |
| yeet(new L("message"))   | throw new Error("message")     |
| new bet((yass, nah))     | new Promise((resolve, reject)) |
| sayLess({JSON})          | JSON.stringify({JSON})         |
| bet.totes([PromiseArray])| Promise.all([PromiseArray])    |

## Contributing

I welcome PRs if you can think of ways to make this even more bussin.

Note: this was designed using Babel 7 and I haven't tested it on anything else. I super don't guarantee that this is totally flawless - it's one of those toy projects that I'll probably publish and forget about.
